# xray

This repository includes a notebook file that applies a CNN to predict whether an xray image has a finding or not. The data used in this tutorial is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

The expected folder setup for this notebook is:
```
- images/
- sample_labels.csv
- xray/
  - script.ipynb
```
